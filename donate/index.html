We are always in need of that special volunteer who loves animals and is willing to do almost any task, no matter how large or small. If you are that person, are 18 years or older, and can give time on a regular basis, we need you.

Some of the volunteer jobs include walking dogs, cleaning their cages, feeding etc. For cats, we also clean cages, litter boxes, floors etc. If you want to be a general volunteer and have no specific interest, we can also use your help around the shelter. Such as doing laundry, folding it, putting it in proper locations, mopping floors, cleaning windows, etc. There are all sorts of things to do. We have a meeting room that has a microwave and refrigerator, all of which need cleaning from time to time. On special occasions we have other duties, such as manning a booth at an event, collating the newsletter and getting it ready for posting, sewing or making dog and cat beds, doing yard work such as pulling weeds, deadheading flowers, and watering the gardens etc. If you have the time we will find the work for you.

Please come in and pick up a volunteer form, fill it out and return it to Buddy. Carmella is the Volunteer Coordinator and will give you a call and set up an interview. Indicate whether you want to help with cats/dogs, or any other specific task you can do.
