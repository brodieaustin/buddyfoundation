      <h2>Our Past</h2>
      <p>To commemorate a much loved collie belonging to an original founder, Buddy took its first breath in February 1995. At that time, a group of concerned animal lovers united to establish a no-kill, safe haven for homeless animals, since the rapid population growth in the northwest suburbs of Chicago made the need for animal care apparent. The founders incorporated, gained their charitable status, and established a dedicated board to oversee Buddy activities.</p>
      <p>Volunteers were recruited to pursue a variety of activities and donation-oriented programs and foster parents were solicited to house and care for our animals. Thanks to our founders, our volunteers and our foster parents, The Buddy Foundation was able to successfully carry out its mission from the beginning through today.</p>

      <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
      <p>We are on a mission to provide immediate safety and care to stray, abused and abandoned animals. Once we are assured animals are medically sound, we place them in a secure, temporary, no-kill environment, usually with a foster family. This immediate placement provides all the love and comfort necessary for their well being and allows us to get to know them. Then, we look for "forever" homes that are committed to their health and happiness for the duration of their lives. When we match an animal with a caring person or family, Buddy is truly fulfilling our purpose of lighting the way home.</p>

      <h2>Our Goal: No more homeless pets!</h2>
      <p>Sadly, 4 to 6 million animals are euthanized each year, the equivalent of 575 every hour. Buddy seeks to reduce that number. We will continue our mission of saving those that cannot fend for themselves, those without a voice, and those who depend on the good will of humanity for their basic needs.</p>
      <p>Buddy also wants to change the perception of an animal shelter. Here, at our new location in Arlington Heights, IL, we provide a safe haven for these special creatures. Each animal is given the one-on-one attention it deserves. The shelter allows Buddy the ability to evaluate each animalâ€™s needs and find a perfect home for as many as possible. If just the right home cannot be found, our animals will stay with us as long as they live.</p>
      <p>We want our sanctuary to be thought of as a place of peace. God gives us the animals to share our lives and in return He expects us to protect them and keep them safe. At Buddy, we live by and spread this message, keeping the memory of one special Buddy alive forever.</p>
